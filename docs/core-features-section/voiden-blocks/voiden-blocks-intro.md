# 🧩 Meet Voiden Blocks

Everything inside Voiden is a **Block** — the smallest, most flexible piece of your API universe.  
Your endpoint? A block. Headers? Blocks. Query params, form inputs, JSON bodies, XML payloads, even binary file attachments — all individual blocks that you can add, remove, or reorder as you build your request.

This modular design keeps the interface clean and clutter-free. Instead of staring at an endless wall of unused fields, you simply add the blocks you need — nothing more, nothing less. Every request becomes a composition of meaningful parts, easy to read, modify, and reuse.

With Voiden Blocks, your API requests are not static forms anymore — they are **living structures**. You can mix, match, and reuse blocks across projects, attach documentation inline, and experiment without losing context. Each block knows what it is and what it contributes.


> No other API tool today offers this level of **composability**.  
> Voiden rethinks the entire workflow — replacing fixed UI templates with a flexible, modular system where you build your requests like you write code: one clean, purposeful block at a time.
