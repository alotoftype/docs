Assertions help you double-check that your API is behaving itself. Think of them as little guards that say, “Hey response… are you sure you’re correct?”  
Voiden proudly supports Assertions as a **reusable block**, because why should only your code get superpowers?

> **Note:** Make sure the **Assertion Plugin** is enabled — without it, your assertions are basically on vacation.

### How to Use the Assertion Block

1. **Add the Block**  
   Type **`/assertion-block`** and—*poof!*—your assertion template appears like a magician’s trick (minus the smoke).

2. **Run It**  
   Give your request a gentle nudge by either:  
   - Pressing **Cmd + Enter** (on macOS) or **Ctrl + Enter** (on Windows/Linux), or  
   - Clicking the big, bright **green  Play button**—the one that screams “press me!”

3. **Check the Results**  
   Slide over to the **Response Panel** — you’ll spot your shiny new **Assertion Check** waiting to tell you if things went perfectly… or hilariously wrong.
