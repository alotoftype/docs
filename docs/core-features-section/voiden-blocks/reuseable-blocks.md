# Reusable Blocks  
**Because repeating the same thing is for parrots, not humans.**

## What Are Reusable Blocks?

Reusable Blocks are your little time-saving buddies.Instead of typing the same **Voiden** blocks again and again (and again…), you create a block once in a **Voiden** file and reuse it everywhere.

## Why You’ll Love Them

- **Save time & energy** – Write once, use everywhere. Your future self will thank you.  
- **Stay consistent** – No more “Why does this header look different here?” moments.  
- **Easy updates** – Change a block once → it updates everywhere. Magic? Almost.  
- **Cleaner docs** – Everything looks neat, organized, and professional.

## How They Work (Sweet & Simple)
1. Type `@` to show the list of linkable file

2. Focus on a void file and press `Space bar` to see the blocks of that file

3. Ta-da! Your block is imported—yes, that easily. Shocking, right?
