# 🎯 Endpoint Block

Every API call starts with a destination and a method.  
The **Endpoint Block** in Voiden gives you both — a clean space to define your `URL` and an `HTTP` method, with a built-in ▶️ Run button right where you need it.

No hidden dropdowns. No separate panels for method selection.
Just type your endpoint, type your method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`), and hit run — all in one focused block.

---

### ▶️ Try it Out

1. In your Voiden file, type `/endpoint` and press Enter to create an **Endpoints Block**.

2. Run the request using **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux),  
**or** click the **green ▶️ Play button** attached to the top right corner of the block.

3. Check the **Response Panel** — you’ll see the status, delay, and the endpoint you sent a request to.

> 🎩 **Pro Tip:** **Endpoints Block** defaults to `GET` method unless you specifically chose a different one.

The Endpoint Block keeps your API calls transparent and ready to run.  
Everything you need — URL, method, and execution — in one visible, editable place.
