# URL Encoded Block

When your API expects form data in the traditional application/`x-www-form-urlencoded` format, this is your block.  
The **URL Encoded Block** in **Voiden** gives you a simple key-value table to define form fields — the same format web browsers use when you submit an HTML form.

Add your fields as rows in the table, and Voiden handles the URL encoding automatically.  
No manual percent-encoding. No worrying about spaces, special characters, or ampersands.

###  Try it Out
1. Type `/url` and press Enter to create a **URL Encoded Block**.

2. Add some url encoded form fields to your request.  
3. Run the request using **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux),  
**or** click the **green  Play button** in the toolbar.

The URL Encoded Block handles classic form submissions with zero hassle.
