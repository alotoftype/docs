# JSON Block

When your API needs data, it usually wants **JSON**.  
The **JSON Block** in **Voiden** gives you a dedicated space to craft your request body — whether you're sending user data, search queries, or configuration objects.  
Type it out or paste it in. Either way, you get a clean editor that understands JSON.

And when things get messy? Hit **Prettify** in the top-right corner to instantly format your JSON into readable, indented perfection.

### ▶️ Try it Out
1. Type `/json` to add a request body block to your Voiden file
2. Paste in (or type) the sample **JSON**
3. Hit **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter**  (Windows/Linux) to run the request  
**or** click the **green ▶️ Play button** in the toolbar.

> 🎩 **Pro Tip:** Want to comment out a field without overkill?  
> Use **Cmd + /** (Mac) or **Ctrl + /** (Windows/Linux) to comment out a JSON line you don't need for that request.  
> It’ll stay visible but won’t be sent with the request.  
> Unless you click the **Prettify** option in the top right corner of the block. Then all the comments will go bye-bye.

The JSON Block keeps your request body visible and editable, right where they belong.  
Just pure JSON.
