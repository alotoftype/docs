# Multipart Table Block

Unlike JSON or XML, which keep things sleek and structured **Multipart** bodies let you send classic form data.  
The **Multipart Table Block** gives you a clean key-value table to define your multipart form data — whether you're uploading profile pictures, submitting forms with attachments, or sending complex payloads that mix text and binary data.  
When you need to send files, images, or mixed data types in a single request, multipart is the way to go.

### Try it Out
1. Type `/multipart` and press **Enter** to create a **Multipart Table Block** in **Voiden**.

2. Add some multipart form fields to your request.  
3. Run the request using **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux),  
**or** click the **green Play button** in the toolbar.

>  **Pro Tip:** Want to temporarily disable a multipart form data field without deleting it?  
> Use **Cmd + /** (Mac) or **Ctrl + /** (Windows/Linux) to comment it out.  
> It’ll stay visible but won’t be sent with the request.

The Multipart Block makes file uploads and mixed-content requests straightforward.  
No manual boundary strings. No content-type confusion. Just a table that sends exactly what you specify.
