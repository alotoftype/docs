# Reusable Blocks  
**Because repeating the same thing is for parrots, not developers.**

## What Are Reusable Blocks?

Reusable Blocks are your little time-saving buddies.Instead of typing the same **Voiden** blocks again and again (and again…), you just create a block once in a **Voiden** file and reuse it everywhere you want.

---

## How They Work 
1. Type `@` to show the list of linkable files or blocks

2. Focus on a void file and press `Space bar` to see the blocks of that file

3. Done! Your block is imported. Yes, that was simple right?

## Why You’ll Love Them

- **Save time & energy** – Write once, use everywhere. Your future self will thank you.  
- **Stay consistent** – No more “Why does this header look different here?” moments.  
- **Easy updates** – Change a block once → it updates everywhere. Magic? Almost.  
- **Cleaner docs** – Everything looks neat, organized, and professional.

## Final Note

Reusable Blocks are here to make your API documentation process smoother and lighter.  
They save your time, reduce copy paste mistakes, and honestly, they make you look super organized — even on days when you are not.
