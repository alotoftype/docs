# Basic Authorization Block

Basic Authorization is a simple authentication scheme where the client sends username and password directly in the api request. The credentials are encoded (but not encrypted) using Base64 encoding.

### Try it Out

1. In your Voiden file, type `/auth-basic` and press **Enter** to create a **Basic Authorization Block**.

**or** click the **green  Play button** in the toolbar.

4. Check the **Response Panel**

> Use **Cmd + /** (Mac) or **Ctrl + /** (Windows/Linux) to comment it out.  
> It’ll stay visible but won’t be sent with the request — perfect for quick testing.
