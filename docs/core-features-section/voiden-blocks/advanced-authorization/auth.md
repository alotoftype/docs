# Authorization Block

Authorization Block provides flexible authentication configuration options for API requests in **Voiden**.
It allows users to easily select and configure various authentication mechanisms supported by **Voiden**.  

While **Voiden** includes another flexible Request Configuration Block [Headers](/docs/core-features-section/voiden-blocks/rest-blocks/headers-block.md)— designed to handle any kind of headers, query parameters, or metadata —
the Authorization Block is primarily responsible for managing authentication and authorization details only.

This separation ensures a clean and modular approach:
- The [Header Block](/docs/core-features-section/voiden-blocks/rest-blocks/headers-block.md) manages custom request data like headers, params, or meta information.
- The Authorization Block manages how a user or service authenticates before making a request.

Together, they allow full control over API requests while maintaining clarity and security.


###  Try it Out

1. In your Voiden file, type `/auth` and press **Enter** to create a **Authorization Block**.

2. Select Authorization type for your **Authorization**.

3. Fill the required params for the Authorization Type.

4. Hit **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter**  (Windows/Linux) to run the request  
**or** click the **green Play button** in the toolbar.

5. Check the **Response Panel** 

> 🎩 **Pro Tip:** Want to temporarily disable a header without deleting it?  
> Use **Cmd + /** (Mac) or **Ctrl + /** (Windows/Linux) to comment it out.  
> It’ll stay visible but won’t be sent with the request — perfect for quick testing.
