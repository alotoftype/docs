# Digest Authorization Block

[Basic Authorization](/docs/core-features-section/voiden-blocks/advanced-authorization/auth_basic.md) is like writing your password on a postcard and mailing it to the server. Sure, it's encoded in Base64, but that's just putting a mustache and glasses on your password - everyone still recognizes it! 

**Authorization Digest** is like a spy proving they know the secret code by showing they can solve the puzzle, without ever revealing the code itself!

###  Try it Out

1. In your Voiden file, type `/auth-digest` and press **Enter** to create a **Authorization Digest Block**.

3. Hit **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter**  (Windows/Linux) to run the request  
**or** click the **green Play button** in the toolbar.

4. Check the **Response Panel** 

###  Block Parameters
| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| username | string | The username registered with the API or server. Used to identify who is making the request. |
| password | string | The secret used to prove your identity. It’s never sent as-is — instead, it’s used to compute a hash that’s compared server-side.|
| real | string | A string defined by the server that indicates the protected area or scope of credentials. It helps the client know which credentials to send. Example: "realm": "User Area". |
| algorithm | string | The hashing method used to encrypt the credentials. Common values are MD5, MD5-sess, or SHA-256. It defines how the response hash is computed. |
