# ⭐ Voiden Git Collaboration Overview

Voiden’s superpower is its native integration with version control systems like [Git ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and platforms such as GitHub, GitLab. This ensures that your workspaces and API collections remain consistent, synchronized, and always current. It also gives you the flexibility to store collections directly alongside your source code for true project co-location.

Collaborating on a Voiden workspace works smoothly across all major Git platforms.  
If you're new to Git or version control concepts, you can explore a beginner-friendly guide [here ↗](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

There are two primary ways to collaborate via native Git in Voiden:

1. **Using the terminal or command line to execute standard Git commands**  
2. **Using Voiden’s built-in, GUI-based Git functionality**

Both approaches allow you to work efficiently, sync updates, manage branches, and collaborate seamlessly with your team.
