> **Note:** This feature is currently in **Beta**.

gRPC in Voiden provides a powerful way to communicate with services using **high-performance, strongly typed APIs**. Built on **Protocol Buffers**, gRPC enables fast data exchange, low latency, and support for streaming communication patterns.

With Voiden’s gRPC support, you can easily create, test, and explore unary and streaming gRPC requests directly from the editor. This makes it ideal for service-to-service communication, real-time data flows, and performance-critical systems—all while keeping APIs clear, consistent, and easy to work with.
