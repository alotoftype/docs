# Skip the Boilerplate, Do What Matters 🚀

Tired of doing the same API integration from scratch? We get it.

If you've already defined your API with **OpenAPI** or tested it in **Postman**, you're halfway done. Why start over?

This tool takes your existing API specs and instantly generates clean, ready-to-use client code. No more manual fetch calls, no more guessing payload structures—just import your definition and get coding.

Your API work should build momentum, not create repetition. Stop reinventing the wheel and start building on what you've already created.

*Import your spec and generate your voiden files in seconds.*
