# Import from OpenAPI

Get started with your existing APIs in seconds. Voiden lets you import OpenAPI specifications and instantly generate ready-to-use API requests.

## Quick Start

### 1. **Open Your OpenAPI File**
- Drag & drop your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file into Voiden
- Or use **File → Open** to select your OpenAPI specification

### 2. **Preview Your Endpoints**
- Click the **"OpenAPI Preview"** button that appears
- Browse all your API endpoints organized by tags
- Use search to quickly find specific endpoints
- Select which endpoints you want to import

### 3. **Generate Voiden Files**
- Click the **"Generate"** button
- Voiden automatically creates a folder with your API's name
- Each endpoint becomes a ready-to-use `.void` request file

## What You Get

✅ **Organized Structure** - Endpoints grouped by tags in subfolders  
✅ **Pre-configured Requests** - Methods, paths, and parameters already set up  
✅ **Ready to Test** - Start making API calls immediately  
✅ **Fully Editable** - Customize generated files as needed  

## Ready to Go!

Your imported APIs are now organized Voiden files. Open any `.void` file and start testing—no manual setup required.
