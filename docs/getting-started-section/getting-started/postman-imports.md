# Import from Postman

Getting started with Voiden using your existing Postman collections couldn't be easier! If you've been testing and building your APIs in Postman, you've already done most of the hard work. Now let's transform that effort into ready-to-use Voiden files.

## What You'll Need:
- A Postman Collection exported as JSON (we recommend using the latest v2.1 format for best results)


> **How to Import in Voiden:** 
> Prefer the quick and easy method? Simply drag your Postman JSON file directly into the file list panel on the left side of Voiden. We'll take it from there!


## Generate Your Voiden Files:

Once your Postman collection is imported, the magic begins:

1. **Open the imported file** - Click on your Postman collection file in the left panel to view its contents
2. **Spot the Magic Button** - You'll see a prominent **"Generate Voiden Files"** button appear - that's your gateway to automated file creation
3. **Watch the Organization Happen** - We automatically create a clean, organized folder structure using your exact Postman collection name
4. **Discover Your New Workflow** - Inside the new folder, every API request from your Postman collection has been intelligently converted into individual Voiden files, complete with all your endpoints, parameters, and configurations

## What Gets Converted?
- All your HTTP endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Request headers and authentication settings
- Query parameters and path variables
- Request body schemas and examples
- Response examples and status codes

## Ready to Roll!
The best part? Once generated, you can immediately start working with your API in the Voiden ecosystem. No manual setup, no copy-pasting, no room for errors.

That's it! In just one click, Voiden transforms your Postman work into a structured, ready-to-use API foundation. Your existing API testing workflow just became your fastest path to production-ready code.
