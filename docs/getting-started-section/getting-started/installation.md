# Installation

Welcome to the part where we pretend reading system requirements is fun.  
Good news — installing Voiden is actually painless.

---

## Download

Head over to **[voiden.md/download](https://voiden.md/download)** and grab the latest release for your platform.  
That’s it. No sign-ups, no tracking, no mysterious “agent” running in the background.  
Just download, install, and start building stuff.

## System Requirements

### macOS
- macOS **11 Big Sur** or later  
- **Apple Silicon** or **Intel** processor  
- **4 GB RAM** (Voiden runs fine on your 2019 MacBook, promise)  
- **200 MB** available space  

### Windows & Linux
- **64-bit OS** (Windows 10+, Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 34+)  
- **Intel or AMD** processor  
- **4 GB RAM**  
- **200 MB** available space  
-  ARM versions coming soon (for Windows & Linux — we see you, Pi enthusiasts)

## Pro Tip
Voiden works **offline-first** — once installed, it doesn’t need the cloud to run.  
Because, well… that’s kind of the whole point.

---

## Uninstalling
Just delete it. Seriously. No leftover daemons, registry keys, or “helpful” background processes.  
Voiden leaves quietly — like a polite developer exiting a Zoom call.

---

Happy testing. Now go break some APIs — *locally*.
