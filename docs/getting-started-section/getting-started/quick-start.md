# 👋 Hello, World

Welcome to your first ride in **Voiden** — no headers to decode, no mysterious 500s to fear, just a friendly **GET** request to kick things off.

We’ll start with a simple URL that echoes whatever you send it.  
Think of it as the world’s most patient API — it listens, nods politely, and repeats everything back.

---

### 🚀 Let’s Get Started

1. Type `/endpoint` to create a new **Request Block**.

2. Paste this URL:  `https://echo.voiden.md`
3. Run it by either:  
- Pressing **Cmd + Enter** (on macOS) or **Ctrl + Enter** (on Windows/Linux), **or**  
- Clicking the bright **green ▶️ Play button** in the toolbar.

4. Check out the **Response Panel** — it’ll return exactly what you sent, like a mirror that speaks JSON.
5. Now, go ahead and **document your request right here**.  
Describe what it does, what to expect in the response, and any use cases or notes worth remembering.  
Voiden lets you blend **docs and requests** in one place — because context belongs *with* the code, not buried in a wiki.

And that’s it — your first Voiden request.  
No payloads, no panic, no drama. Just clean, quiet success.

> 💡 **That’s the thing about Voiden:** your API documentation isn’t static — it’s alive.  
> You can write your docs right in the editor and drop in the exact blocks you need, when you need them.  
> Slash commands make it effortless — everything in Voiden is a block.  
> No clutter. No tabs everywhere. Just you, your words, and the requests that matter.
