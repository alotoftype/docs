> **Note:** This feature is currently in **Beta**.

The **Git Integration GUI** in Voiden provides a visual, approachable way to work with Git repositories—without requiring you to memorize commands or live in the terminal. It allows you to view changes, stage files, create commits, manage branches, and track history through a clean and intuitive interface.

Git GUI is designed to make version control easier to understand while still respecting Git’s core concepts. Whether you’re new to Git or an experienced developer who prefers visual clarity, the Git GUI helps you stay in control of your codebase.

## Why a Git GUI Matters

Git is powerful, but it can also feel overwhelming—especially when things go wrong. A GUI helps bridge that gap by making Git’s behavior visible and predictable.

Using a Git GUI helps you:

- Understand what’s changing before you commit
- Avoid accidental commits or lost work
- Reduce mistakes caused by complex commands
- Learn Git concepts visually and incrementally
- Work faster by seeing the full context at once

In Voiden, the Git GUI is built to support thoughtful, review-driven workflows rather than rushed command execution.

## Core Concepts You’ll See in the Git GUI

### Repository Status
Shows the current state of your working directory:
- Modified files
- New (untracked) files
- Staged changes
- Clean working tree

This gives you instant feedback on what Git sees right now.

---

### File Changes (Diff View)
View exactly what changed in each file:
- Line-by-line additions and deletions
- Clear separation between staged and unstaged changes
- Visual comparison with previous versions

This helps you commit only what you intend to.

## Summary

The Git GUI in Voiden makes version control **visible, understandable, and safer**. It doesn’t hide Git—it explains it through structure and clarity. By showing you exactly what’s happening at every step, the Git GUI helps you work confidently, collaborate effectively, and keep your project history clean and intentional.
