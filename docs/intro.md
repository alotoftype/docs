# Welcome to Voiden Hub

#### Your slightly self-aware, occasionally sarcastic, but genuinely helpful documentation hub.

---

**Hi.** You’ve made it.  
You’re here because you either:  
1. Installed Voiden and thought, *“Wait, what does this button do?”*  
2. Broke something and are now googling your way through existential dread.  
3. Or you just *love reading documentation* (in which case… wow. We respect you. Fear you, even.)

## What is Voiden?

Voiden is an offline-first API client and workspace for developers who want clarity, speed, and control. It lets you build, test, and link API requests like reusable blocks, comment on JSON or XML, preview responses (even PDFs or videos), and manage environments, themes, and scripts — all without ever needing the cloud. Think of it as your API lab: local, fast, beautifully nerdy, and just the right amount of judgmental.

## Philosophy

We believe in clarity, speed, and autonomy — because no one should need a login just to poke an endpoint.
Voiden is for devs who like their tools fast, local, and a little rebellious.

## Now what?

👉 Head to [**Installation**](./getting-started/installation.md) before you start clicking random buttons.  
(Or don’t. We’re not your boss. But you might regret it.)
