# ✏️ Basic Blocks

Before diving into the fancy API magic, let’s start with the basics — the everyday building blocks that make up your Voiden document.  

Basic Blocks are your standard Markdown elements: **headings, lists, tables, code blocks, quotes**, and more.  
You can add them just like in Markdown, or use Voiden’s **slash commands** (`/h1`, `/list`, `/table`, etc.) to insert them instantly.

## 🧱 What Are Basic Blocks?

Voiden is a visual editor built on top of Markdown.  
Everything you see — from titles to tables — is still pure Markdown underneath.  
No hidden markup. No weird formatting. What you write here can live happily in Git, versioned and readable by humans.

Basic Blocks help you write documentation, structure your API notes, or format your examples directly inside the same document as your API requests.

## ⚡ How to Use

Type `/` and you’ll see a list of available blocks:  
- **Heading 1 / 2 / 3** → For sections and titles  
- **Bullet List / Numbered List** → For itemized info  
- **Code Block** → For examples and snippets  
- **Table** → For describing request parameters or data  
- **Quote** → For notes, tips, or friendly reminders  

You can also just type regular Markdown syntax (`#`, `-`, ````` `````, `>`, etc.) — Voiden will render it beautifully in real time.

## 🪄 Why It Matters

These blocks are the foundation of your Voiden documents.  
You can combine them with **REST API blocks** — endpoints, headers, request bodies, and so on — to create live documentation that’s both human-readable and machine-executable.

Nothing fancy. Nothing hidden.  
Just Markdown, but with superpowers.
