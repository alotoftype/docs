# The Basics

Before you start conjuring API magic, let’s cover a few Voiden fundamentals — the kind that make everything click.

---

## The Voiden Editor

Voiden ships with its own custom editor, built on top of **Tiptap** (a rich-text editor that’s secretly Markdown in a nice outfit).  
This isn’t just a text box — it’s your playground for building, linking, and commenting on API blocks like a pro.

You can write, format, insert blocks, comment on JSON, add notes, and still keep everything cleanly stored as Markdown underneath.  
Because plain text is forever.

---

## Files and Structure

Everything in Voiden is, at its core, a **Markdown file**.  
We just use the `.void` extension — not because we’re fancy, but because it makes it easier for Voiden to process your files, track blocks, and work its behind-the-scenes magic.

Think of `.void` files as Markdown with superpowers.  
They’re still readable, editable, and totally version-controllable.

## Git-Friendly by Design

No databases. No proprietary formats. No “export to Markdown” button.  
Your Voiden projects are **pure Markdown**, ready to commit, diff, merge, and roll back — just like any source code.

- Want to see what changed? Run `git diff`.  
- Need to resolve a conflict? Open it in your favorite editor.  
- Want to brag about a perfect merge? Go ahead, you’ve earned it.

Voiden keeps your workflow transparent, flexible, and 100% yours.

> **TL;DR:**  
> Every Voiden file is Markdown at heart — `.void` is just its superhero alias.
